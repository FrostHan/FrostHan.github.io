## Research Interests

Hi there, I am a researcher in the Shanghai AI/ML group of Microsoft Research Asia.

I am interested in neural networks, both artificial ones and biological ones, as well as the principles underlying decision making. In particular, my ultimate research objective is to understand the computational mechanisms of the brain and create machines as intelligent as humans.

### Research directions


- Computational neuroscience / cognitive science
- Spiking neural networks
- Deep reinforcement learning
- Brain-inspired artificial intelligence
- Embodied artificial intelligence
- Brain-computer interface
